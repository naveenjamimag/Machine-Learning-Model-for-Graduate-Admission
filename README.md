The USA has been the favorite hub for higher education in the world most importantly for Graduate education. Every year thousands and thousands of students come to the USA for studies.

The admission procedure as long as it can be essentially split into various phrases where the last one being the decision to Admit or Reject. It sometimes becomes stressful and also involves a large sum of money in applying to a number of universities.
So, we plan to use machine learning to expedite the process to get to know the chance of getting an admit from the university that an applicant is applying.

Goals:
Our goal is to apply machine learning algorithms to admission data set to build two models
